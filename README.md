# config
This is where my configurations go.

## Install

 Put this in `~/.bashrc`:
```
# source scripts from repo if they exist
if [ -f ~/M/dotfiles/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/M/dotfiles/.bash_aliases
fi
```

## Todo

- [ ] make symlink to `.vimrc`
    - `ln -s <target> <linkname>`
- [ ] find the fn-ctrl keymapping
- [ ] move `own.sty` to appropriate location

## Programs I use

This is just a list for myself to memorize which programs I need on a fresh install.

- git
- tmux
- chromium-browser
- evince
- pandoc
- shutter

- [ ] a window manager (i3?)
- [ ] a file manager
- [ ] an image viewer?

Less frequently used, can be installed on demand:

- meld
- gimp
- gparted
- virtualbox
- pdftk
